-> the admin panel to be designed first 
-> the admin will be hardcoded for authentication 
-> will have a student, user tables for records and admin logins , fee tables for amounts, paid status date method etc 
-> flow will be that admin will login thru hard coded data and there will be CRUD operations like adding deleting students marking them as paid and issue the notices for fees
